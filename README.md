# Atlas, a statically-typed programming language

[Atlas](https://github.com/IsaacAderogba/atlas) is a statically-typed programming language that adopts the beat features from TypeScript and Python.

> Atlas, like many of my projects, has been primarily built for my use cases. If you wish to extend the base functionality, you're encouraged to fork the package.
